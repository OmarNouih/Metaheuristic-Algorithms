## Algorithms

### Improved Atom Search Optimization (IASO)
IASO is an enhanced version of the Atom Search Optimization (ASO) algorithm. It includes improved mechanisms for global and local search to ensure better performance in finding optimal solutions.

#### Key Features:
- Enhanced search capabilities
- Balanced exploration and exploitation
- Suitable for various optimization problems

### Social Mimetic Optimizer (SMO)
SMO is a memetic algorithm that combines social and cultural evolution concepts with traditional optimization techniques. It leverages social learning and individual learning to improve the search process.

#### Key Features:
- Integrates social and individual learning
- Adaptable to different types of optimization problems
- Utilizes a hybrid approach for better optimization

### Barnacles Mating Optimizer (BMO)
BMO is inspired by the mating behavior of barnacles. It utilizes their unique reproductive strategies to explore and exploit the search space effectively.

#### Key Features:
- Inspired by natural mating behaviors
- Effective in finding optimal solutions
- Competitive with other evolutionary algorithms
